Azure Network Connection Monitor is a network monitoring solution within Azure Network Watcher that helps you monitor network connectivity between:
- Azure VMs
- Virtual networks (VNets)
- Internet endpoints
- On-premises endpoints

Here are the key aspects:

Monitoring Tests:
- Connectivity: Checks if endpoints can communicate
- Latency: Measures network delay
- Packet loss: Tracks data loss between endpoints
- Network topology: Maps the network path between source and destination

Key Components:
1. Test Group
   - A container for multiple test configurations
   - Defines common properties like frequency and thresholds

2. Test Configuration
   - Source endpoints: Where the test originates
   - Destination endpoints: Target resources to test connectivity
   - Test frequency: How often to run tests (default is 5 minutes)
   - Protocol: TCP or HTTP
   - Success thresholds: Define acceptable latency and packet loss

3. Monitoring Agents
   - Network Watcher extension on VMs
   - Log Analytics agent for on-premises servers

Benefits:
- Real-time monitoring of critical network paths
- Early detection of connectivity issues
- Historical data for trend analysis
- Customizable alerts based on thresholds
- End-to-end network visibility

Common Use Cases:
- Monitor connectivity between branch offices
- Verify application availability across regions
- Track performance of hybrid cloud connections
- Troubleshoot network issues proactively
