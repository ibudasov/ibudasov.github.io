Azure Network Connection Monitor is a network monitoring solution within Azure Network Watcher that helps you monitor network connectivity between:
- Azure VMs
- Virtual networks (VNets)
- Internet endpoints
- On-premises endpoints

Here are the key aspects:

Monitoring Tests:
- Connectivity: Checks if endpoints can communicate
- Latency: Measures network delay
- Packet loss: Tracks data loss between endpoints
- Network topology: Maps the network path between source and destination

Key Components:
1. Test Group
   - A container for multiple test configurations
   - Defines common properties like frequency and thresholds

2. Test Configuration
   - Source endpoints: Where the test originates
   - Destination endpoints: Target resources to test connectivity
   - Test frequency: How often to run tests (default is 5 minutes)
   - Protocol: TCP or HTTP
   - Success thresholds: Define acceptable latency and packet loss

3. Monitoring Agents
   - Network Watcher extension on VMs
   - Log Analytics agent for on-premises servers

Benefits:
- Real-time monitoring of critical network paths
- Early detection of connectivity issues
- Historical data for trend analysis
- Customizable alerts based on thresholds
- End-to-end network visibility

Common Use Cases:
- Monitor connectivity between branch offices
- Verify application availability across regions
- Track performance of hybrid cloud connections
- Troubleshoot network issues proactively

## Container instances

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers. For Windows containers, Azure Container Instances only supports deployment of a single container instance. While we are working to bring all features to Windows containers, you can find current platform differences in the service

## Azure AD

You can set expiration policy only for Office 365 groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## WebApp

You can validate web app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot. Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. You can automate this entire workflow by configuring auto swap when pre-swap validation isn't needed.
After the swap you can deploy the App1 update to webapp1-test, and then test the update. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as per your expectation then you can perform the same swap immediately to get your "last known good site" back.

## Azure Storage

Encryption scopes enable you to manage encryption with a key that is scoped to a container or an individual blob.

Server Message Block (SMB) is used to connect to an Azure file share over the internet. The SMB protocol requires TCP port 445 to be open.
