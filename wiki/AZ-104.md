Azure Network Connection Monitor is a network monitoring solution within Azure Network Watcher that helps you monitor network connectivity between:
- Azure VMs
- Virtual networks (VNets)
- Internet endpoints
- On-premises endpoints

Here are the key aspects:

Monitoring Tests:
- Connectivity: Checks if endpoints can communicate
- Latency: Measures network delay
- Packet loss: Tracks data loss between endpoints
- Network topology: Maps the network path between source and destination

Key Components:
1. Test Group
   - A container for multiple test configurations
   - Defines common properties like frequency and thresholds

2. Test Configuration
   - Source endpoints: Where the test originates
   - Destination endpoints: Target resources to test connectivity
   - Test frequency: How often to run tests (default is 5 minutes)
   - Protocol: TCP or HTTP
   - Success thresholds: Define acceptable latency and packet loss

3. Monitoring Agents
   - Network Watcher extension on VMs
   - Log Analytics agent for on-premises servers

Benefits:
- Real-time monitoring of critical network paths
- Early detection of connectivity issues
- Historical data for trend analysis
- Customizable alerts based on thresholds
- End-to-end network visibility

Common Use Cases:
- Monitor connectivity between branch offices
- Verify application availability across regions
- Track performance of hybrid cloud connections
- Troubleshoot network issues proactively

## Container registry 

Only pemium suppots pivate endpoints
ACR tasks are suppoted by all the tiers

## Container instances

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers. For Windows containers, Azure Container Instances only supports deployment of a single container instance. While we are working to bring all features to Windows containers, you can find current platform differences in the service

## Azure AD

A device identity is an object in Microsoft Entra ID. This device object is similar to users, groups, or applications. A device identity gives administrators information they can use when making access or configuration decisions.
- Microsoft Entra registration
     
     Bring your own device (BYOD)

     Mobile device (cell phone and tablet)

- Microsoft Entra join
     
     Windows 11 and Windows 10 devices owned by your organization
     
     Windows Server 2019 and newer servers in your organization running as VMs in Azure

- Microsoft Entra hybrid join is seen as an interim step on the road to Microsoft Entra join. All three scenarios can coexist in a single organization.

When a user inherits a license from a group, you can't directly remove or modify that license in the user's properties. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-group-advanced#direct-licenses-coexist-with-group-licenses

Group-based licensing currently doesn't support groups that contain other groups (nested groups). If you apply a license to a nested group, only the immediate first-level user members of the group have the licenses applied.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-group- advanced#limitations-and-known-issues

You can set expiration policy only for Office 365 groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

The New-MgUser cmdlet is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, which is a module that allows you to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. The Microsoft Graph API is a service that provides access to data and insights across Microsoft 365, such as users, groups, mail, calendar, contacts, files, and more. The New-MgUser cmdlet can be used to create new users in your Azure AD tenant, but it has some limitations and requirements. For example, you need to have the Global Administrator or User Administrator role in your tenant, you need to authenticate with the Microsoft Graph API using a certificate or a client secret, and you need to specify the required parameters for the new user, such as userPrincipalName, accountEnabled, displayName, mailNickname, and passwordProfile.
However, the New-MgUser cmdlet does not support creating guest user accounts in your Azure AD tenant. Guest user accounts are accounts that belong to external users from other organizations or domains. Guest user accounts have limited access and permissions in your tenant, and they are typically used for collaboration or sharing purposes. To create guest user accounts in your Azure AD tenant, you need to use a different cmdlet:
New-AzureADMSInvitation. This cmdlet is part of the Azure AD PowerShell module, which is a module that allows you to manage your Azure AD resources and objects. The New- AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet can be used to create and send an invitation email to an external user, which contains a link to join your Azure AD tenant as a guest user. You can also specify some optional parameters for the invitation, such as the invited user display name, message info, redirect URL, or send invitation message. Therefore, to meet the goal of creating guest user accounts for 500 external users from a CSV file, you need to use a PowerShell script that runs the New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet for each user, not the New-MgUser cmdlet.

## WebApp

You can validate web app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot. Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. You can automate this entire workflow by configuring auto swap when pre-swap validation isn't needed.
After the swap you can deploy the App1 update to webapp1-test, and then test the update. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as per your expectation then you can perform the same swap immediately to get your "last known good site" back.

## Azure Storage



Premium SSD that uses zone-redundant storage (ZRS) Use Premium SSD for lowest latency and highest performance.
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.

----

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your data synchronously across three storage clusters in a single region.
LRS would not remain available if a data center in the region fails GRS and RA GRS use asynchronous replication.

ZRS only support GPv2.
Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs

----

You can set a maximum of five access policies on a container, table, queue, or share at a time. Each SignedIdentifier field, with its unique Id field, corresponds to one access policy. Trying to set more than five access policies at one time causes the service to return status code 400 (Bad Request).

Container-level scope
When support for version-level immutability policies has not been enabled for a storage account or a container, then any immutability policies are scoped to the container. A container supports one immutability policy and one legal hold. Policies apply to all objects within the container.
Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/define-stored-access-policy https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-storage-overview


Object replication is supported for general-purpose v2 storage accounts and premium block blob accounts. Both the source and destination accounts must be either general-purpose v2 or premium block blob accounts. Object replication supports block blobs only; append blobs and page blobs aren't supported.
1. Blob versioning should be enabled on both the source and destination storage account.
2. Change feed should be enabled on the source account
Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/object-replication-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/object-replication-configure? tabs=portal#prerequisites

Premium file shares are hosted in a special purpose storage account kind, called a FileStorage account.

Encryption scopes enable you to manage encryption with a key that is scoped to a container or an individual blob.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/encryption-scope-overview#how-encryption-scopes-

Server Message Block (SMB) is used to connect to an Azure file share over the internet. The SMB protocol requires TCP port 445 to be open.

If you define more than one action on the same blob, lifecycle management applies the least expensive action to the blob. For example, action delete is cheaper than action tierToArchive. Action tierToArchive is cheaper than action tierToCool.

To access blob data in the Azure portal with Azure AD credentials, a user must have the following role assignments:
1. A data access role, such as Storage Blob Data Reader or Storage Blob Data Contributor 2. The Azure Resource Manager Reader role, at a minimum
The Reader role is an Azure Resource Manager role that permits users to view storage account resources, but not modify them. It does not provide read permissions to data in Azure Storage, but only to account management resources. The Reader role is necessary so that users can navigate to blob containers in the Azure portal.
Note: in order from least to greatest permissions:
1. The Reader and Data Access role
2. The Storage Account Contributor role
3. The Azure Resource Manager Contributor role 4. The Azure Resource Manager Owner role
Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access

AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account.

You can configure network routing preference for your Azure storage account to specify how network traffic is routed to your account from clients over the internet. By default, traffic from the internet is routed to the public endpoint of your storage account over the Microsoft global network. Azure Storage provides additional options for configuring how traffic is routed to your storage account.

Azure Import/Export service supports the following of storage accounts:
1. Standard General Purpose v2 storage accounts (recommended for most scenarios)
2. Blob Storage accounts
3. General Purpose v1 storage accounts (both Classic or Azure Resource Manager deployments),
Azure Import/Export service supports the following storage types: 1. Import supports Azure Blob storage and Azure File storage
2. Export supports Azure Blob storage
Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-import-export-requirements

ZRS currently supports standard general-purpose v2, FileStorage and BlockBlobStorage storage account types.
 
Live migration is supported only for storage accounts that use LRS replication. If your account uses GRS or RA-GRS, then you need to first change your account's replication type to LRS before proceeding. This intermediary step removes the secondary endpoint provided by GRS/RA- GRS.
Also, only standard storage account types support live migration. Premium storage accounts must be migrated manually.

ZRS currently supports standard general-purpose v2, FileStorage and BlockBlobStorage storage account types.

## Network

If Peering status to both VNet1 and Vnet2 are disconnected - these networks are unreachable. We need to update or re-create the remote peering to get it back to Initiated state.

All the VNets, no matter the region, can be peered, even though it is a regional service

If a virtual network has address ranges that overlap with another virtual network or on-premises network, the two networks can't be connected.
You can connect virtual networks (VNets) by using the VNet-to-VNet connection type. Virtual networks can be in different regions and from different subscriptions. When you connect VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions don't need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.

Network performance monitor allows you to monitor connectivity and latencies across hybrid network architectures, Expressroute circuits, and service/application endpoints. With an data collector set we can count specified network traffic, but we cannot inspect it. For this we would need a network watcher Packet Capture.

Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoint provides secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Service Endpoints enables private IP addresses in the VNet to reach the endpoint of an Azure service without needing a public IP address on the VNet.
Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview

IP flow verify
The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that you can resolve the problem.

Connection troubleshoot
The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time.
Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-connectivity-overview


## LB

A Basic Load Balancer can use the Basic SKU Public IP address's, but a Standard load balancer requires a Standard SKU Public IP address.

To load balance with basic load balancer backend pool virtual machines has to be in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set.
A health probe is used to determine the health status of the instances in the backend pool. During load balancer creation, configure a health probe for the load balancer to use. This health probe will determine if an instance is healthy and can receive traffic. A Load Balancer rule is used to define how incoming traffic is distributed to the all the instances within the Backend Pool. So if you delete the rule, load balancing won't happen.

Basic load balancer supports Virtual machine in a single Availability set or virtual machine scale set (VMSS) only . 
Basic load balancer supports Virtual machine in a single Availability set or virtual scale set only or one standalone VM. VM3 and VM4 are not part of any availability set or VMSS .Hence this statement is incorrect.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview


## FW

Azure Firewall
- Dynamic IPv4: No
- Static IPv4: Yes
- Dynamic IPv6: No 
- Static IPv6: No
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses#at-a-glance


## RBAC

Owner role - Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC.

The Contributor role can manage all resources (and add resources) in a Resource Group. Reference:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview

The Owner Role lets you manage everything, including access to resources.
The Network Contributor role lets you manage networks, including creating subnets.
The Security Admin role: In Security Center only: Can view security policies, view security states, edit security policies, view alerts and recommendations, dismiss alerts and recommendations.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider- operations#microsoftnetwork

## Tags

Tags applied to the resource group or subscription aren't inherited by the resources although you can enable inheritance with Azure Policy
Tags applied to the resource group or subscription aren't inherited by the resources 

## Locks

- A read-only lock on a resource group that contains a virtual machine prevents users from moving the VM out of the resource group.
- A read-only lock on a resource group prevents users from moving any new resource into that resource group. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources?tabs=json

## Backup / Recovery

Blobs cannot be backup up to service vaults.
To create a vault to protect virtual machines, the vault must be in the same region as the virtual machines.

You can set up a Recovery Services vault and configure backup for multiple Azure VMs.

Backup policy, do one of the following:
1. Leave the default policy. This backs up the VM once a day at the time specified, and retains backups in
the vault for 30 days.
2. Select an existing backup policy if you have one.
3. Create a new policy, and define the policy settings.
What happens when I change my backup policy?
When a new policy is applied, schedule and retention of the new policy is followed.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-configure-vault 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-backup-faq

After you configure firewall and virtual network settings for your storage account, select Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account as an exception to enable Azure Backup service to access the network restricted storage account. As this required setting is missing , so Azure backup will not be able to take backup of unmanaged disks.

## VM

When you redeploy a VM, it moves the VM to a new node within the Azure infrastructure and then powers it back on, retaining all your configuration options and associated resources.
References:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/redeploy-to-new-node

When you move a virtual machine from one subscription to another, you need to ensure that all the dependent resources are also moved along with it.

A virtual machine may have an association to multiple DCRs, and a DCR may have multiple virtual machines associated to it.
In the Resources tab, add the resources (virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, Arc for servers) that should have the Data Collection Rule applied.

On the Destination tab, add one or more destinations for the data source. You can select multiple destinations of same of different types, for instance multiple Log
Analytics workspaces (i.e. "multi-homing").
Note: The Data Collection Rules (or DCR) improve on a few key areas of data collection from VMs including like better control and scoping of data collection (e.g. collect from a subset of VMs for a single workspace), collect once and send to both Log Analytics and Azure Monitor Metrics, send to multiple workspaces (multi- homing for Linux), improved Windows event filtering, and improved extension management.

Fo the faultDomain - Use max for platformFaultDomainCount - 2 or 3 is max value, depending on which region you are in.
Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.
