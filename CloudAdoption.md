A cloud adoption framework is a set of guidelines and best practices that help organizations successfully adopt cloud technologies and migrate their workloads to the cloud in a structured manner.

- Assessment: Helps organizations understand their current environment and identify applications or workloads that are good candidates for migration. This includes assessing factors like technical readiness, security requirements, compliance needs etc.
- Planning: Involves creating a roadmap for the cloud adoption journey. This includes planning activities like developing migration strategies, estimating costs and resources required, setting timelines and milestones etc.
- Implementation: Provides guidance on how to execute the cloud migration plan in a phased manner. This covers steps like standing up infrastructure in the cloud, re-architecting and refactoring applications, testing solutions in the cloud etc.
- Governance: Offers best practices for ongoing cloud governance after migration. This involves things like setting policies and standards for security, operations, cost optimization in the cloud.
- Optimization: Guides organizations on continuously improving and maximizing the value derived from cloud technologies. This includes activities like modernizing applications, adopting new services, refining processes etc.
- The cloud adoption framework helps align an organization's cloud strategy with its business goals and ensures a well-planned, governed transition to cloud environments. Major cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud offer their own customized cloud adoption frameworks to help customers leverage cloud computing.
