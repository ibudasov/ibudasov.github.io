# RBAC

> RBAC uses an allow model for access. By default everything is forbidden. Roles summarize: `read` + `write` might come from 2 different roles

- Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription and another user to manage virtual networks.
- Allow a database administrator (DBA) group to manage SQL databases in a subscription.
- Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as VMs, websites, and virtual subnets.
- Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group.


# Policies

- use a policy to restrict to which Azure regions you can deploy resources.
- use a policy to restrict which types of virtual machine sizes can be deployed. 
- use a policy to enforce naming conventions

# PowerShell

- can be connected to your Account/Subscription
- got 
  - `cmdlet`, which are modules
    - modules can be installed and reused 
- can do scripting (base for cmdlets)
- can do pyping `$vm | Get-AzVMSize`
- command outputs are objects `$vm = (Get-AzVM -Name "testvm-eus-01" -ResourceGroupName learn-bce21a4b-3352-4e88-8d15-680d3dc88c35)` 
- Can be assigned to a variable, and then output as a whole or a part of it, a property `$vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk` 

# Resource Manager

> ðŸ’¡ You can download resources as ARM JSON, edit it and redeploy

> ðŸ’¡ Use parameters for settings that vary according to the environment

## Resource Groups
 are at their simplest a logical collection of resources. There are a few rules for resource groups.
- Resources can only exist in one resource group.
- Resource Groups cannot be renamed.
- Resource Groups can have resources of many different types (services).
- Resource Groups can have resources from many different regions.
- If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within the group are also deleted.
- There are a few factors that can play into the strategy you use to organize resources:
  - **Authorizatios**: Because resource groups are a scope of RBAC, you can organize resources by who needs to administer them.
  - **Lifecycle**: If you delete a resource group, you also delete all the resources in the group. Use this to your advantage, especially in areas where resources are more disposable, like non-production environments.
  - **Billing**: placing resources in the same resource group is a way to group them for usage in billing reports.

## Tags
 Use them for
- department (like finance, marketing, and more)
- environment (prod, test, dev)
- cost center
- lifecycle and automation (like shutdown and startup of virtual machines)
- use Azure Policy to automatically add or enforce tags for resources

## Temlates benefits
- Templates improve consistency. 
- Templates help express complex deployments.
- Templates reduce manual, error-prone tasks.
- Templates are code.
- Templates promote reuse
- Templates are linkable. 
- Templates simplify orchestration

- is an abstraction over JSON of ARM
- got:
  - Simpler syntax
  - Modules
  - Auto dependency management
  - Type validation

# Azure VWAN

Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that allows you to centrally manage and configure routing for your hybrid and multicloud networks. With Virtual WAN, you can connect multiple virtual networks together under a single routing construct called a Virtual WAN hub. This hub acts as a central point that connects all of your spokes (virtual networks) together.

- **Hub-spoke topology** - Allows you to connect multiple virtual networks (spokes) back to a central routing point (hub). This simplifies connectivity and routing management.
- **Built-in VPN gateway support** - Lets you connect your on-premises networks to the Virtual WAN hub using Azure VPN gateways.
- **Centralized routing** - Routing policies are defined centrally at the hub so all spokes inherit the same routing behavior and connectivity. This replaces the need to configure routing individually at each spoke.
- **Integration with Azure security services** - You can integrate the Virtual WAN hub with services like Azure Firewall to filter and inspect traffic centrally as it passes through the hub.
- **Transitive routing** - Traffic can flow "through" the hub between any two spokes without having to egress and re-enter the hub. This simplifies connectivity between spokes.
