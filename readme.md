# Igor: Software and Cloud Engineering Specialist

Greetings, I am Igor. I embarked on my journey in Software Engineering in 2007 and transitioned into the realm of Cloud Engineering in 2016. 

I hold a Master's degree in System Engineering, complemented by certifications in AWS/Azure, Kubernetes, and Terraform. These qualifications have equipped me to assist my clients in various areas, including [cloud migration](), [site reliability enhancements](), and [application modernisation]().

My professional interests extend to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and data streaming technologies, areas in which I continually seek to expand my knowledge and expertise.
