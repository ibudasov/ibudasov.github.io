# Cloud service models

Cloud computing resources are delivered using three different service models:

- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** provides instant computing infrastructure that you can provision and manage over the Internet.
  - VMs (I need to manage onfiguring firewalls, updating VM OS's, updating DBMS's, and runtimes.)
  - Pros (over on-prem)
    - Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost: 
    - Improves business continuity and disaster recovery
    - Respond quicker to shifting business conditions
    - Increase stability, reliability, and supportability
- **Platform as a service (PaaS)** provides ready-made development and deployment environments that you can use to deliver your own cloud services.
  - no licenses
  - no integrations
  - no managing updates, network
  - Reduced development time
  - Use sophisticated tools affordably: A pay-as-you-go model
  - Support geographically distributed development teams
  - Efficiently manage the application lifecycle
- **Software as a service (SaaS)** delivers applications over the internet as web-based services.
  - web-apps
