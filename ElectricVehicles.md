# Motor
- **heat engine** (internal combustion(IC): steam, disel, gasoline)
  - complex, heavy, big, expensive
  - maintenance 
  - wearing out
  - 75% of efficiency
  - non-renewabable enrgy
  - non-health exhaust
  - Co2
- **electric engine**
  - simpler construction (one moving part - rotor)
  - loght, compact, cheap
  - energy efficient (100%)
  - lasts forever
  - no exhaust

# Fuel 
- stores a lot of energy in compact way

# Battery
- way worth storage of energy than fuel
- in practice does not mater much ðŸ¤”
- weight of batteries is evolutionally reducing 
- leads to cheaper vehicles
- generates a lot of heat

# Six errors when comparing CO2 emissions

- Overestimating battery manufacturing
- Underestimating battery lifetime
- Assuming an unchanged electricity mix over the vehicle's lifetime
- Using unrealistic tests for energy use
- Excluding fuel production emissions
- Lack of system thinking

# Types of vehicles
- Hibrid EV - EV + IC = recharges battery on braking
  - not nuch  useful
  - not much power comes from electricity
- Plugin Hybrid = uses both elecric engine with battery and ICE
  - complex
- Full EV
  - cheaper
  - low maintenance
  - pedal driving with regeneration
- Hydrogen Fuel cell
  - smaller battery
  - refueling is fast
  - efficiency is lower than FEV

# Motors characteristics
- Electrotechnical
- Mechanical
- Practical
- Economic
- Environmentsl

# Motor types
- DC brushed
- Induction (basic)
  - no brushes, more control
  - industry standard
  - async
- Permanent Magnet Rotor (best performet)
  - sync
  - less heat and losses
  - the best
  - needs expensive metals
- Sync Reluctance Motor (best all around)
  - good efficiency
  - cheaper, no magnets
  - noice


# Power electrnics in EV

- Power elect convertor
  - power elec switch - turn on and off frequently
  - Converts AC (Alternating Current) -> DC (Direct Current) and back
  - Magnetic Isolation â€” yes/no
  - Bidirectional Power flow â€” bdirectional or unideirectional

# Regen braking

- ICV turn kinetic energy to heat using braking system. Non recyclable.
- EV return this energy to batteries
  - reguces energy consumptions
  - longer range
  - less maintenance

Limits
- limited by power and speed, so cannot be exclusively used
- limited to axle where the motor is connected

# Range

Factors that Affect the Range of an Electric Vehicle

1. Temperature: Nearly 60% of the fuel that enters the ICE in fuel-powered cars is used to produce heat

2. Rolling Resistance: The main source of EV energy consumption at low speeds is rolling resistance. When EVs carry heavy batteries â€“ more energy is needed to drive for significant ranges.

3. Wind Resistance: The faster a car moves, the more air it has to move through and the more energy it wastes to get through the wind.
